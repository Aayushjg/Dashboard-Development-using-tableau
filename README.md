**For The Task 3 of the internship, I focused on developing an interactive dashboard to visually represent key insights from a sales dataset using a business intelligence tool. The purpose of this task was to enhance my skills in data visualization and storytelling by building a dynamic and intuitive dashboard that helps stakeholders quickly understand important business metrics. The dataset I used, sales_data.csv, was a synthetic yet realistic dataset containing 1,000 records of retail transactions. It included fields such as Date, Region, Product, Category, Quantity, Price, and Sales Amount. This data offered a well-rounded view of business operations, making it ideal for various visualization use cases.To create the dashboard, I used Tableau Public, a widely used and beginner-friendly data visualization tool. I began by loading the dataset into Tableau and performing an initial exploration of the fields. My first step was to clean and format the data where necessary, ensuring that dates were recognized correctly, and categorical fields like Region and Category were properly classified. I then moved on to building individual visualizations that would later be combined into a single dashboard.Some of the key visualizations I created included a bar chart showing total sales by region, which clearly highlighted which geographic areas were contributing most to the revenue. I also created a line chart to track monthly sales trends over time, helping to identify seasonal spikes and drops in business performance. A pie chart representing sales distribution by product category offered insights into which business segments were performing best. Another important visualization was a top 5 products chart, where I ranked products based on total sales amount, allowing for quick identification of bestsellers.
To improve interactivity and user experience, I added filters and slicers that allowed viewers to filter the data by Region, Category, and specific date ranges. This made the dashboard more dynamic and adaptable to specific business questions or scenarios. All visuals were combined into a single dashboard layout, where they could interact with each other in real time. Clicking on a region or category would automatically update all charts to reflect only the relevant subset of data.The final dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of sales performance across various dimensions. It served as a useful tool for business users to quickly grasp revenue distribution, identify sales leaders, and monitor performance over time. By designing the layout with both aesthetics and functionality in mind, I ensured the dashboard was not only informative but also easy to use.**
